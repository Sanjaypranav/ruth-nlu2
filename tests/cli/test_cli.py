    Checks that a call to ``ruth --help`` does not import any slow imports.

    If this is failing this means, that a simple "ruth --help" commands imports
    `tensorflow` which makes our CLI extremely slow. In case this test is failing
    you've very likely added a global import of "tensorflow" which should be
    avoided. Consider making this import (or the import of its parent module)
    a local import.

    If you are clueless where that import happens, you can run
    ```
    python -X importtime -m ruth.__main__ --help  2> import.log
    tuna import.log
    ```
    to get the import chain.
    (make sure to run with python >= 3.7, and install tune (pip install tuna))
